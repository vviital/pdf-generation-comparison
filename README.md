# PDF generation comparison

The repository contains comparisons of the PDF generation engines, such as PDFMake & Puppeteer for their performance.

The tests are made under Docker with different types of load:
- small-sized load (1-2 pages with 1 image);
- medium-sized load (10-15 pages with 10 images);
- large-sized load (60-70 pages with 50 images).

## The result of the research:
